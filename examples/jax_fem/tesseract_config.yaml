version: "0.1.0"
description: |
  Tesseract that computes the compliance of a structure under load via JAX-FEM.
  The structure is defined by a set of 3D piecewise linear tubes (bars) that is
  converted to a signed distance field internally. The compliance is computed
  using the finite element method (FEM) implemented in JAX-FEM.

  Simulation is performed in 2D (x-y plane) with zero thickness in the z-direction. 
  Also returns the von-Mises stress field of the structure mesh for visualization.
