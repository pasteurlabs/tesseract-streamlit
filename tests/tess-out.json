  "greeting": "Hello John Doe! You are 30 years old. That's pretty good. Oh, so tall? 175.0 cm! Wow. You must be very successful. You are 83.0 kg? That's much larger than an atom, and much smaller than the Sun, so pretty middling all things considered. Your left leg is 100.0 and your right leg is 100.0 - is that normal? Ah, I see you do hula hoop as a hobby! That's great. You've got 3 years of experience, and you're  actively doing it. I guess that's somewhat interesting. Anyway, pretty cool you're alive."
